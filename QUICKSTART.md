## ⚡ Troubleshooting

### "Please enter your Gemini API key"
➡️ Make sure you've pasted your API key in the text field at the top

### "Failed to generate image"
➡️ Check if your API key is valid  
➡️ Verify you have internet connection  
➡️ Try a different photo  

### Images taking too long
➡️ Generation creates 9 images sequentially (1-2 minutes is normal)  
➡️ Check your internet speed  
➡️ Free tier API might be slower during peak times  

### Cropper not appearing
➡️ Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser  
➡️ Try refreshing the page  
➡️ Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
